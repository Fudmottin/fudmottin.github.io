  <h1>Creating The Future</h1>
  <p>I've devised a brilliant technical solution to sequester CO2 from the
     atmosphere using only water and sunlight. All I need now is funding!
     This method is scientifically proven to be effective. We can sequester as
     much CO2 as needed to become net negative!</p>
