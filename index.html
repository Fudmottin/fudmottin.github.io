  <h1>Creating The Future</h1>
  <p>I've devised a brilliant technical solution to sequester CO₂from the
     atmosphere using only water and sunlight. All I need now is funding!
     This method is scientifically proven to be effective. We can sequester as
     much CO₂ as needed to become net negative!</p>

  <p>We start with a simple pilot facility to prove the concept: low cost, net
     carbon negative. We don't compete with farmland or housing. We just turn
     CO₂ into cash!</p>

  <p>Forget the noisy Direct Air Capture systems with their power hungry fans.
     This revolutionary system gives us less CO₂ in our air for chicken feed.</p>
